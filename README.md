# 8 bit emulated computer
This repository holds the source code for the microcontroller of the 8 bit emulated computer project that I worked on as part of the ECE 120 Honors Lab at UIUC. It also contains a Python utility I made to convert binary rom files into hexadecimal to be included in compilation.
